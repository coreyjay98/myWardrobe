              This is the first thing you must do to create your wardrobe. 
              Either sign in to an existing user or create a new one. 
              There currently is no facility to remove your account.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each item you add will subsequently be added alongside your user
              name and called forward in the carousels. Your outfits similarly.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h4 id="my-wardrobe-instructions">My Wardrobe</h4>
            <p>From this page you create the outfit you want to wear.</p>
            <p>Click on the items displayed in the carousels to add them
              to the creator view at the top of the page. If you select the
              wrong item or an item twice you can click on the incorrect item
              in the creator and it will immediatly be removed from selection.
            </p>
            <p>If (like me) you have too many clothes you can filter the carousels
              by category using the drop down filter menu. You will have to filter
              `View All` to resume the full selection.
            </p>
            <p>If you want to start again with your creation, you can hit the clear
              outfit button.
            </p>
            <p>Once you have finished type a name for your outfit into the Outfit
              name field and hit the create outfit button.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you do not provide a name or create an outfit with no items,
              the message box at the top of the screen will alert you,
              and instruct with how to proceed creating outfits.
            </p>
            <p>
              Look out for these message bars as they will display useage tips
              while you are creating.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you have created an outfit the creator will clear, indicating
              the action has been registered and you can create again.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4 id="saved-outfits-instructions">Saved Outfits</h4>
            <p>
              When you have created an outfit they are displayed in this tab.
              Scroll left and right to view all of your creations.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you wish to plan an outfit for a particular day, select the
              outfit and the day followed by the add to calander button.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you select a day that already has an outfit saved, the current
              outfit will be replaced with the new one.
            </p>
            <p>
              The calander bar displays the name of the outfit you have saved for that
              day.
            </p>
            <p>
              To remove the outfit, select the calander day with the outfit listed and
              hit the remove from calander button.
            </p>
            <p>
              To delete an outfit, select the outfit and click the delete button.
              If the outfit is stored in the calander when you delete an outfit,
              the messages bar will ask you to remove it from the planner first.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you hit any of the buttons without making a selection, or not enough
              selections as described above the messages bar will alert you to how to
              proceed.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4 id="add-new-instructions">Add New Item</h4>
            <p>
              This page allows you to add to your wardrobe.
            </p>
            <p>
              You must fill in the boxes, name of the item, colour, pattern, weight.
              You must also upload an image to go with your selection or the create
              feature will not work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Advice: weight should be Heavy, Light, Medium, Sheer, Thick, but it is
              not restricted. This property currently has no feature attached.
            </p>
            <p>
              Select from the drop down menu, tops bottoms or overalls. Overalls are
              dresses and dungeree.
            </p>
            <p>
              These 3 options will sort the item in the carousel and further display a
              category list for the type of garment.
              Please pick only one, though there is no restriction.
            </p>
